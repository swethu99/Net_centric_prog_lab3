            <p>Network-centric Computing focuses on large-scale distributed computing systems and applications that communicate through open, wide-area networks like the Internet. Typical examples of large-scale network-centric systems are the World-Wide Web and Computational Grids. Research in Network-centric computing focuses on the challenges that arise in the context of the study, the design, the implementation and the operation of efficient, scalable, and robust internet-based services and applications at a global scale.</p>

                <h4>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT</h4>
              <p> <mark>Performance and Reliability Evaluation of Heterogeneous Grids:</mark> Development of techniques and software tools for the performance exploration and personalized ranking of computing resources available through large-scale Grids, according tothe characteristics of user workloads.<br>
                <mark>Grid Reliability and Dependability:</mark> Development of probabilistic modeling techniques to represent failures in Grid infrastructure components and to understand the effect thereof to Grid reliability. Also, development of novel techniques for the automatic detection and avoidance of failures in Grids with the goal to improve Grid Dependability.</br>
                <mark>Search Engines:</mark> Study of techniques for the management of metadata that are published by large-scale, network-centric information systems. Our goal is to develop Search Engines that will enable the integration of and search for information published by network-centric systems. </br>
                <mark>Web Mining:</mark> Investigation of the behavior of Web robots (crawlers) that traverse the Web collecting content on behalf of Search Engines and other Internet services. To this end, we perform a characterization study of the HTTP interactions taking place between robots and Web servers, which are registered in Web-server access logs.</br>
                <mark>Application-layer Service Protocols:</mark> Design, simulation and implementation of application-layer protocols that can be used for the development and deployment of novel, location-based services in peer-to-peer and vehicular ad-hoc networks.</br>

            <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s[35] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL),capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's Benevolent Dictator For Life, a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. He now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected Brett Cannon, Nick Coghlan, Barry Warsaw, Carol Willing and Van Rossum to a five-member "Steering Council" to lead the project.</p>

            <p>The scope of net-centric computing is broader than embedded systems. But the topic is of vital importance for embedded developers because “embedded” is whatever an embedded developer does. Net-centric computing has, as a whole, all of the features and requirements of the embedded market: small footprint, high reliability, and determinism. The developers who will be in most demand will be embedded hardware and software developers, regardless of whether they are developing for desktops, servers, routers, bridges, information appliances, set-top boxes, or traditional embedded devices.p>
